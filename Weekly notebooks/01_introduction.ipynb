    "# Week 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this first hands-on tutorial! In this notebook, we’ll explore how to train a neural network for image classification using **PyTorch**, a popular deep learning framework. Our dataset of choice is the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, a well-known collection of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels each) across 10 categories, such as airplanes, cats, and cars. Each category contains 6,000 images, providing a rich dataset for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will build a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, a foundational type of artificial neural network. An MLP consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: Processes the raw image data.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: Extract meaningful patterns and features.\n",
    "- **Output Layer**: Maps the learned features to one of the 10 image classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connections between nodes in these layers are weighted, and the network learns to adjust these weights during training to improve classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll understand how to:\n",
    "1. Preprocess image data for neural network training.\n",
    "2. Build and train an MLP using PyTorch.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the performance of the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive in and start building!"

    "### Step 1: Import libraries and load the CIFAR-10 dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we’ll prepare our tools and data to kickstart the project. First, we’ll import the necessary libraries that make it possible to handle data, build and train neural networks, and visualize results effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll load the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using `torchvision`. As a quick refresher, the CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) evenly distributed across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cats, and cars). Each class has 6,000 images, providing a balanced and diverse dataset for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure optimal model performance, we’ll also **normalize** the images. Normalization scales the pixel values of the images to a similar range, typically around 0, making it easier for the model to learn and speeding up the convergence process during training."

By examining these images, we can gain insights into the patterns, textures, and challenges involved in classifying them correctly.
